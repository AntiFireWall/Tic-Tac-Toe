# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game made using C++ and Qt Gui Library. The players can take turn placing either an X or O on the grid until one of them gets 3 in a row OR the grid is full in which case it would be a stalemate.

The purpose for writing this software is to show what I learned of C++.

## Development Environment

**Programing Language**: C++

**Runtime environment**: MinGW (If you download the Qt Creator IDE the MinGW will be installed with it)

**IDE(Integrated Development Environment)**: Qt Creator 17.0.1 (Community)

## Useful Websites

- [Qt Website](https://www.qt.io)
- [Qt Documentation](https://doc.qt.io)

*Note: If you download the Community version of the IDE the download speed will be very slow because It will prioritizes licensed versions over the Community version. You can try to get the educational version instead which may make your download speed faster.*

## Future Work

- Make the program reset to default state insted of restarting.
- Added a diffrent victory display that will turn the grid into the winners symbol.
- Make the program remamber the player names inputed by the user for futur use.
